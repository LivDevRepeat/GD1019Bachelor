# Erlking

Who rides so late through night and wind?
It is the father with his child;
He holds the boy tightly in his arm,
He keeps him safe, he keeps him warm.

"My son, why do you hide your face in fear?"
"Do you not see, father, the Erlking?
The Erlking with his crown and tail?"
"My son, it is but a streak of mist."

"Dear child, come, go with me!
I will play beautiful games with you;
Many colorful flowers are by the shore,
My mother has many golden garments."

"My father, my father, do you not hear
What the Erlking softly promises me?"
"Be calm, stay calm, my child;
The wind rustles in the dry leaves."

"Do you want, fine boy, to come with me?
My daughters shall wait on you beautifully;
My daughters will lead the nightly dance
And lull and dance and sing you to sleep."

"My father, my father, do you not see there
The Erlking's daughters in the dark place?"
"My son, my son, I see it clearly:
The old willows appear so gray."

"I love you, your beautiful form entices me;
And if you are not willing, I will use force."
"My father, my father, now he is grabbing me!
The Erlking has done me harm!"

The father shudders; he rides swiftly,
He holds the groaning child in his arms,
He reaches the courtyard with difficulty and effort;
In his arms, the child was dead.
