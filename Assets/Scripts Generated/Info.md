# Notes on Scripts Generated by LLM

## 1. Source of Scripts
All scripts in this repository are generated by LLM (Large Language Model).

## 2. Issue of Identical Class Names
There's an observation that files can sometimes be generated from the same prompt by different models. This can result in scripts having identical class names. To prevent potential conflicts:

- **Solution**: Namespaces are employed within the scripts.

## 3. Errors in Unity
There are instances when the generated script might lead to errors in Unity. In such cases, modifications to the script may be necessary for compatibility and functionality.

## 4. Model Disclosure
For transparency, the specific model used in the generation of each script is always disclosed.

## 5. Unity Tags
To facilitate easier integration and identification, specific Unity tags are included within the scripts.

*It's recommended to review the generated scripts thoroughly before integration to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.*
