Iâ€™m developing a Pinball Game based on Kirby Pinball (for GameBoy Color). I use the unity Game Engine version 2022.3.4f1. I need you to generate a Monobehavior C# script and if needed a tutorial for the necessary components to add. I has the following requirements:
 Life that can be edited in the editor.

Unity Event life increase
Unity event life decrease
Unity ent game over

Function that increases life variable by one
Function that decreases life variable and checks if its zero if it is it shall call  the game over function
Function gameover  

All the functions need to subscribe to the respective unity events on awake
